# WhoHog

### Description
Find how many bytes and gb are being used by each directory inside of the current working directory. Also get the percentage of file system storage being used by each directory. 

### Usage
`./whohog <file_system_mount_location>`

### Motivation
I was given access to a shared server to do hw, but the file system ran out of space. I wanted to know _who_ was _hogging_ all of the space.
